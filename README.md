# 🚀 My DevWorks
This repository contains a collection of C# projects that I have developed as part of my portfolio, showcasing modern Web Application development using ASP.NET MVC, Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI design, SQL Server for database management, and several Windows Applications demonstrating practical desktop software skills.

# Soft Landing
This project aims to create a seamless and secure user data registration form using ASP.NET Core MVC and MySQL for data storage.  
The project features a simple and user-friendly interface, with the ability to expand later to support additional features such as email verification and notifications.

# Features ✨
- User registration with validation
- Secure data storage in MySQL
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap 5
- Easy to expand for future features
- Clean and modern interface
