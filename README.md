# 🚀 My DevWorks
This repository contains a collection of C# projects that I have developed as part of my portfolio, showcasing modern Web Application development using ASP.NET MVC, Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI design, SQL Server for database management, and several Windows Applications demonstrating practical desktop software skills.

# Soft Landing
